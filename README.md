# Team morale (Frontend)
_(Final project from school)_  
Team morale is a service to study and learn about server sent events applied to real time web experience.

### Idea
Team morale is a service to track and analyze the morale of a team by getting inputs from their daily stand ups.

The users can sign up and create teams. Then, every team can meet up digitally and register their status of that day (energy level, productivity level and well-being level).When the teams meet up in a "room" they can see others status (this is the real time effect).   
All users will get other users registering updates instantly when they are in the room.
